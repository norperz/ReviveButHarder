# ReviveButHarder
ReviveButHarder is an edit of [Globox1997's Revive Mod](https://github.com/Globox1997/Revive) to change obtainment of revival items to be more difficult.

# Items
Unlike the original mod, the only way to obtain a Revival Star is to craft it from a Nether Star.<br />
It also removes the Golden Apple potion recipe for a lesser revival potion.
